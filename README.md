# File-finder
locating and writing file recursively in java
when the file is located, it creates a folder named "File Finder" on your desktop (if it does not exist) and writes the file(s) to that folder and notifies you.
I am thinking of modifying it in the future to incldue regex search and to make the gui better looking
contributions are welcome
